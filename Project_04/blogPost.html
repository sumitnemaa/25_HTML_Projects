          Welcome to my first blog post! This is where I share my thoughts on
          web development, design, and technology.

          Learning HTML is the first step in becoming a great web developer. By
          understanding how to structure content, you can create readable,
          accessible, and well-organized pages.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ”Web development is both an art and a science. Structure matters!”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Stay tuned for more posts, where I’ll dive into CSS and JavaScript to
          make these pages more dynamic.
